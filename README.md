# NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT MAP
## A project from Udacity
This project is about writing an app that use Google APIs to show pin locations in a map.  These pins need to have connected to other external API. I use Yelp API to show the image, rating, and a user text review.

Another requirement is to use Knockout.js framework to show the list of locations, and include a search box that filter this list.  When you mouseover on any location the related pin change of color and if you click the infowindow will open.
